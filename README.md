# Chatbot-Using-Python-
This is a chatbot made using NLP and keras. Chatbots are used a lot in customer interaction, marketing on social network sites and instantly messaging the client. Chatbot is trained on a dataset which contains categories, pattern and responses. We use a LSTM to classify which category the userâ€™s message belongs to and then we will give an accurate response from the list of responses.
